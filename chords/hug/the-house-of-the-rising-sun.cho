[Am]  [C]  [D]  [F]  [Am]  [E7]  [Am]  [E7]

There [Am]is a [C]house in [D]New Or[F]leans
They [Am]call the [C]Rising [E7]Sun
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Am]God I [E7]know I'm [Am]one [E7]

My [Am]mother [C]was a [D]tailor [F]
She [Am]sewed my [C]new blue [E7]jeans
My [Am]father [C]was a [D]gamblin' [F]man
[Am]Down in [E7]New Or[Am]leans [E7]

Now the [Am]only [C]thing a [D]gambler [F]needs
Is a [Am]suitcase [C]and a [E7]trunk
And the [Am]only [C]time that [D]he's satis[F]fied
Is [Am]when he's [E7]on a [Am]run [E7]
{colb}

Oh [Am]mother [C]tell your [D]children [F]
Not to [Am]do what [C]I have [E7]done
[Am]Spend your [C]lives in [D]sin and mise[F]ry
In the [Am]House of the [E7]Rising [Am]Sun [E7]

Well I got [Am]one foot [C]on the [D]platform [F]
The [Am]other foot [C]on the [E7]train
I'm [Am]goin' [C]back to [D]New Or[F]leans
To [Am]wear that [E7]ball and [Am]chain [E7]

Well there [Am]is a [C]house in [D]New Or[F]leans
They [Am]call the [C]Rising [E7]Sun
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Am]God I [E7]know I'm [Am]one [E7][Am]
