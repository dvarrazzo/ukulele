Desert [Bb]love in your [F]eyes all the [Bb]way
If I [Bb]listen to your [F]lie would you [Bb]say
I'm a [Eb]man... without con[F]viction
I'm a [Eb]man... who doesn't [F]know
How to [Eb]sell... a contra[F]diction
You come and [Eb]go
You come and [Gm]go [F]

Didn't [Bb]hear your wicked [F]words every [Bb]day
And you [Bb]used to be so [F]sweet I heard you [Bb]say
That my [Eb]love... was an add[F]iction
When we [Eb]cling... our love is [F]strong
When you [Eb]go... you're gone for[F]ever
You string a[Eb]long
You string a[Gm]long [F]
